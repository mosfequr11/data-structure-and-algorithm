    // What is a Linked List?
    // A linked list is a linear data structure similar to an array.However, unlike arrays, elements are not stored in a particular memory location or index. Rather each element is a separate object that contains a pointer or a link to the next object in that list.
    // Each element(commonly called nodes) contains two items: the data stored and a link to the next node.The data can be any valid data type.

    // const list = {
    //   head: {
    //     value: 6
    //     next: {
    //       value: 10
    //         next: {
    //         value: 12
    //             next: {
    //           value: 3
    //                 next: null
    //         }
    //       }
    //     }
    //   }
    // }

    //An advantage of Linked Lists
    // Nodes can easily be removed or added from a linked list without reorganizing the entire data structure.This is one advantage it has over arrays.
   
  // Disadvantages of Linked Lists
  // Search operations are slow in linked lists. Unlike arrays, random access of data elements is not allowed. Nodes are accessed sequentially starting from the first node.
  // It uses more memory than arrays because of the storage of the pointers.

    // Types of Linked Lists
    // There are three types of linked lists:
    // Singly Linked Lists: Each node contains only one pointer to the next node.This is what we have been talking about so far.
    // Doubly Linked Lists: Each node contains two pointers, a pointer to the next node and a pointer to the previous node.
    // Circular Linked Lists: Circular linked lists are a variation of a linked list in which the last node points to the first node or any other node before it, thereby forming a loop.
    
    
    // Some LinkedList methods
    // Next up, we will implement four helper methods for the linked list.They are:
    // size()
    // clear()
    // getLast()
    // getFirst()
